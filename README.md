# GPpyTools
Readout of Plugin information from Gig Performer .gig files or Global Plugin Manager settings

usage:
     GPpyTools.py -s               : extracts PLUGINS from 'Gig Performer.settings' and write to 'GigPerformerPlugins.xlsx' in same folder
     GPpyToos.py <gigfie.gig>      : extracts PLUGINS from 'gigfile.gig' and write to 'gigfile.gig.xlsx' in same folder

The created excel files can by filtered, e.g. to figure out which rackspace uses a specific Plugin in which format (AU, VST, VST3).

Initial script back in 2021.

Have fun!
